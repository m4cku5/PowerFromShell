    directories and sends an email via DirectSend, if certain limits are exceeded.

.NOTES
    Version:            1.0
    Author:             Michael J. Mattingly
    Creation Date:      07/16/2020
    Purpose/Change:     This script, which began as "FolderMonitor.ps1", has been renamed as
                        "Test-Folders.ps1", for the purpose of meeting Microsoft's suggested naming 
                        convention (e.g. Verb-Noun pair). Due to said change, I have decided to roll back 
                        the version number to 1.0. Quite a bit of documentation and logic was added to this 
                        version. The script now supports testing multiple paths instead of just one, has 
                        the ability to exclude or include file extensions, has dynamic time limits and 
                        email bodies and subjects, and the Send-EmailAlert() function was rewritten to be 
                        as agnostic as possible, so that dynamic variables could be pulled in from another 
                        function.

        The Get-BodyAndSubject() function returns a $body and $subject variable, depending upon the $path

        function to use it.

function Get-FileCount {

    .SYNOPSIS
        The Get-FileCount() function, using a file limit and file count, calculates how many files, if any,

        The Send-EmailAlert() function defines static email parameters, pulls in the $body and $subject
